This is the Documentation repository where we put all the documentation for the ASE project. Go to the <a href="https://github.com/org-uzh-ase/documentation/wiki/ASE-Project">Wiki</a>, everything you need is there.

The actual web application "The Very Stressful Movie Quiz" is distributed among four repositories which are all under the <a href="https://github.com/org-uzh-ase">organization org-uzh-ase</a> we created. If you want even more detailed information on the services, each service has its own README as well. The corresponding containers can be found on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/vladmasarik">DockerHub</a>.

The source code documentation can be found <a href="https://org-uzh-ase.github.io/documentation/">here</a> and the REST API is documentated on <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/ltoedt/ASE/0.1">SwaggerHub</a>.
